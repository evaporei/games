# games

Links to the games I've made so far. At the time of this writing I'm mainly using [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/).

- [agar.io](https://github.com/evaporei/agar.io)
- [breakout](https://github.com/evaporei/breakout)
- [tic tac toe](https://github.com/evaporei/tic-tac-toe)
- [snake](https://github.com/evaporei/snake)
- [flappy bird](https://github.com/evaporei/flappy-bird)
- [pong](https://github.com/evaporei/pong)

I may start uploading to https://itch.io in the future. Specially when I stop just doing bare clones...
